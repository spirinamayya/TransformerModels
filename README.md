# Defining transformer model architecture

Model implementation

RecTools folder
- Models
    Model implementation can be found in RecTools folder. It contains content copied from https://github.com/MobileTeleSystems/RecTools.git that was done as a part of this project. In further experiments this functionality will be installed using pip install rectools[torch] to make it more comfortable. 
- Examples
    Shows example of how models can be used for fit/recommend and provides theoretical background
